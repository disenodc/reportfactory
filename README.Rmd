# Welcome to reportfactory!

## reportfactory in a nutshell 

{reportfactory} is a lightweight R package which facilitates a workflow for compiling multiple `.Rmd` reports using `rmarkdown::render()` within a folder. 

There a few key principles it adheres to:

- *Lightweight* Low dependencies for easy installation in environments where internet connections are unreliable. 
- *Reproducible* Time-stamped names and folders make viewing the same report over time a breeze.
- *Time-saving* Easy convenience functions to compile one or many reports

## Installing the package

To install the development version of the package, use:

```{r install2, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("reconhub/reportfactory")
```

Note that this requires the package `remotes` installed.

## Quick start

### Step 1 - Create a new factory
Create and open a new factory. Here, we create the factory with a default template but stay in our current activities (set `move_in` to TRUE to switch projects). Check out more templates at [reconhub/report_factories_templates](https://github.com/reconhub/report_factories_templates).

```{r creation}
library(reportfactory)
factory_proj <- "new_factory"
new_factory(file.path(factory_proj), include_template = TRUE, move_in = FALSE)
```

### Step 2 - Add your reports
Here we've already created some with the `include_template` being set to TRUE (the default). The helper functions below show the state of the factory.

```{r listing}
list_reports(factory_proj)
list_outputs(factory_proj)
list_deps(factory = factory_proj) # list all needed packages
```

### Step 3 - Compile report(s)

#### Option 1 - A single report
The `compile_report()` function can be used to compile a report using its name, or a partial match for its name. This is useful when you're actively working on developing a single report.

```{r compile_one, eval=FALSE}
compile_report("example_report_2019-01-31.Rmd", factory = factory_proj, quiet = TRUE)
```

Use helper functions to see progress.
```{r compile_one_results}
list_outputs(factory_proj)
```

#### Option 2 - All reports with updates
Compile all reports to get their outputs. By default, this just compiles the most recent versions.

```{r compile_allupdated}
update_reports(factory_proj)
list_outputs(factory_proj)
```

#### Option 3 - All reports
Compile all reports to get their outputs. By default, this just compiles the most recent versions.

```{r compile_all}
update_reports(factory_proj, all = TRUE)
list_outputs(factory_proj)
```

### Step 4 - Consolidate latest outputs
You can now get a single directory of the latest report outputs using:

```{r shipit}
ship_reports(factory = factory_proj, most_recent = TRUE)
list.dirs(factory_proj)
```
